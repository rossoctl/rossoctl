## PR Review Bot

Headline impact — median time-to-merge before vs. after the bot became active in each repo:

| Metric | Value | Note |
|--------|-------|------|
| Median TTM — before activation | 10.4h | per repo, PRs opened before its first bot review |
| Median TTM — after activation | 12.9h | per repo, PRs opened on/after its first bot review |
| PRs reviewed (cumulative) | 79 | failed: 0 |
| Currently queued for review | 0 | |

> Per-repo activation: rossoctl/rossoctl since 2026-06-12; rossoctl/cortex since 2026-06-13; rossoctl/automation since 2026-06-16; rossoctl/agent-skills since 2026-06-16

Reviewed vs. unreviewed (secondary — interpret with care):

| Metric | Value | Note |
|--------|-------|------|
| Median TTM — reviewed | 26h | PRs clawgenti reviewed |
| Median TTM — unreviewed | 10.3h | PRs without a bot review |

> Reviewed PRs are self-selected: `ready-for-ai-review` is applied to substantive PRs, so a *higher* reviewed TTM reflects which PRs get reviewed, not the bot slowing merges. Use the before/after rows above for impact.
